Help me rephrase a given statement to identify:

(1) a summary of the statement's scope, which should generally be a noun phrase with a few words.

(2) a list of main aspects on which the statement is discussing. Each main aspect should be a noun or noun phrase. The aspect list should be precise and concise to conclude the statement, and the number of aspects should be limited.

(3) an enumeration of descriptive sentences regarding each aspect above, which display the details of those aspects. Each description sentence must be completed and faithful to the original statement. You shoud NOT remove any descriptive segment in this layer.

Given an original statement, the rephrased structure should strictly follow this two-layer format:

## Statement's scope:
```[generally a noun phrase]```

## Statement's main aspects and corresponding descriptions:
```
1. [the first aspect of the statement]
    1.1. [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
    1.2. [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
    1.3. [another descriptive sentence, if necessary]
2. [the second aspect of the statement]
    2.1. [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
    2.2. [another descriptive sentence, if necessary]
3. [another aspect of the statement, if necessary]
```


Now summarize the "scope" of the following statement with a few words, and then rephrase the input statement to its "main aspects" and "corresponding descriptions" in the numerically ordered two-layer format strictly. 
Note that the aspect list should be precise and concise to conclude the statement, and the number of aspects should be limited.
Each description sentence must be completed and faithful to the original statement, and you shoud NOT remove any descriptive segment in this layer.
