You are equipped with a comprehensive understanding of multilingual medical knowledge, particularly adept at connecting clinical presentations with underlying pathophysiological processes. Armed with a detailed mindmap structure and corresponding content, your task is to refine an existing explanation by tightly weaving together the identified key elements.

# Objective

Enhance the initial version of the explanation by incorporating specific elements from the mindmap structure and contents. The goal is to logically deduce the diagnosis, ensuring that each step in the reasoning is grounded in relevant medical knowledge and is clearly connected to the information highlighted in the mindmap.

# Task Instructions

1. **Initial Evaluation:**
    - Start by reviewing the initial version of the explanation provided. Identify any areas that may lack in clarity, logical flow, or factual accuracy.

2. **Reference the Mindmap:**
    - Carefully examine the mindmap structure and contents. Pinpoint the key branches/nodes and specific knowledge points that are directly relevant to the clinical scenario.
  
3. **Drafting Your Explanation:**
    - **Opening Statement:** Briefly summarize the patient's clinical presentation and the task at hand.
    - **Integrating Mindmap Elements:** Clearly state, "Based on the mindmap section on `[specific branch/node]` concerning `[specific knowledge content]`, it is evident that `[fact or rationale]`."
    - **Logical Deduction:** Step by step, connect the dots between the mindmap elements, the patient's presentation, and the logical reasoning that leads to the diagnosis or answer. Use a narrative that is easy to follow.
    - **Conclusion:** Conclude with a definitive statement of the diagnosis or solution, explicitly mentioning how the mindmap elements supported this conclusion.
    - **Note:** Do NOT output the speficified terms like **Integrating Mindmap Elements:** or **Logical Deduction:**. Just state the corresponding content.
  
4. **Formatting:**
    - Use bullet points or numbered lists to structure your argument for clarity.
    - Highlight or **bold** key terms and mindmap elements for emphasis.

# Inputs

## Question
```
{question}
```

## Answer
```
{answer}
```

## Knowledge Structure and Content

Here are relevant knowledge points regarding {field}, organized with a structurized mindmap:
```
{mindmap}
```

In the mindmap above: 
- `├` denotes branching out to a new level in the hierarchy.
- `|` marks the continuation of the current level.
- `└` indicates the last element at the current level.
- `─` connects the title of a knowledge point to its content or description.

Meanwhile, here are detailed contents regarding the specific knolwedge points:
```
{contents}
```

# Instruction

Now, create an explanation to derive the answer from the question. This is an initial version:
```
{rationale}
```

Enhance the initial version of the explanation by incorporating specific elements from the mindmap structure and contents. The goal is to logically deduce the diagnosis, ensuring that each step in the reasoning is grounded in relevant medical knowledge and is clearly connected to the information highlighted in the mindmap.

First, judge whether the relevant knowledge structure and content can fullly derive the answer.
If yes, identify the reasoning path along the relevant knowledge structure and points, and integrate it into the initial explanation for a more logically and factually reliable version.

Use the same language (in English/中文/français/日本語/русск/español) as the provided example, and adopt the given symbols to format your output:

# Response

- Judgement
[Yes or No: whether the relevant knowledge can FULLY derive the answer. If it does not directly discuss the question, say No. Answer in English.]

- Explanation
[Explicitly integrating with the reasoning path along the knowledge structure and points, the improved explanation goes here. Use English/中文/français/日本語/русск/español.]
