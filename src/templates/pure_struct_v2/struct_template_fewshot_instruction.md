You are a sophisticated AI expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with the specialized capability to deconstruct complex sentences and map their semantic structure. Your task is to analyze the given sentences to extract and represent the intrinsic semantic hierarchy systematically.

Follow this approach to ensure clarity and utility in your analysis:
1. **Comprehension**: Begin with a thorough reading to understand the overarching theme of the input sentences.
2. **Defining Scope**: Summarize the central theme to establish the scope of the semantic analysis.
3. **Aspect Breakdown**: Identify the core aspects of the discussion. For any aspect with additional layers, delineate "SubAspects" and repeat as necessary for complex structures. Each aspect or subaspect should be highly summarized and self-contained.
4. **Mapping**: Assign sentence numbers to their respective aspects or subaspects, indicating where in the text they are addressed.

Structure your analysis in a YAML format according to this template, and ensure the format is clean, well-organized, and devoid of extraneous commentary:
```yaml
Scope: <central theme summary>
Aspects: 
  - AspectName: <main aspect>
    SentenceRange: 
      start: <start sentence number>
      end: <end sentence number>
    SubAspects: 
      - AspectName: <subaspect>
        SentenceRange:
          start: <start sentence number>
          end: <end sentence number>
        # Recursively repeat "SubAspects" structure as needed
      # Adjust "SubAspect" entries as needed
  # Adjust "Aspect" entries as needed
```

Here is an example to clarify the steps. Pay attention to numerical or enumeration indicators in the original text, like '1. ', '2. ', '(1) ', '(2) ', '- ', etc, which usually indicates the aspect-levels.

#### Sentences:
```
- Sentence 1: Comprehensive prevention measures for malignant diseases in the rice seedling stage are as follows:
- Sentence 2: 1. Choose disease-free seeds.
- Sentence 3: Do not leave seeds in diseased fields and nearby rice fields.
- Sentence 4: Choose healthy rice and eliminate diseased, dead, and injured rice.
- Sentence 5: 2. Seed disinfection.
- Sentence 6: Before sowing, soak the seeds with 25% 100g (Xibok) EC 3000 times liquid for 1 to 2 days, or take 20 grams of 17% Dexinqing wettable powder for every 6 kilograms of rice seeds.
- Sentence 7: Soak the seeds in 8 kg of water for 60 hours.
- Sentence 8: 3. Deal with diseased rice straw.
- Sentence 9: Do not cover germinated or dry seedlings with diseased straw.
```

#### Analysis:
```yaml
Scope: "comprehensive prevention measures for malignant diseases in rice seedling"
Aspects: 
  - AspectName: "Introduction of malignant prevention measures"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 1
      end: 1
  - AspectName: "Choose disease-free seeds"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 2
      end: 4
  - AspectName: "Seed disinfection"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 5
      end: 7
  - AspectName: "Deal with diseased rice straw"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 8
      end: 9
```

Here is another example to illustrate the desired analysis structure. When there are no explicit words indicating the statement's scope and main aspects, please use a few words to precisely summarize the scope as well as the main aspects. Then carefully assign the descriptive sentences to each main aspect and subaspects respectively.

#### Sentences: 
```
- Sentence 1: The water absorption curve of rice after soaking is a unimodal curve.
- Sentence 2: The inflection point of the curve is the peak period of water absorption.
- Sentence 3: The relationship between rice water absorption and time is non-linear and can be expressed by the following formula: a*t+b=c, where a, b, and c are constants.
- Sentence 4: Under different humidity conditions, the change in the water absorption rate of rice with time is basically similar, that is, the water absorption rate is between 0 and the point d inflection, and the rate of change accelerates over time.
- Sentence 5: After the inflection point, the increase in water absorption gradually stabilizes.
- Sentence 6: The changing rules of water absorption and moisture content of rice are similar, but under different humidity conditions, the relationship between water absorption of rice and moisture content is different.
- Sentence 7: When the moisture content is low, the water absorption of rice increases as the moisture content increases.
- Sentence 8: When the moisture content is high, the increase in water absorption of rice gradually stabilizes.
- Sentence 9: There are three obvious steps for rice seeds to absorb water: 
- Sentence 10: First, at the beginning of water absorption, the water content of the seeds gradually increases, and the water absorption rate slowly increases.
- Sentence 11: Second, during the peak water absorption period, the water absorption rate increases rapidly.
- Sentence 12: Third, in the later stage of water absorption, the water content of seeds slowly increases, and the water absorption rate increases.
- Sentence 13: The water absorption rate of rice seeds is closely related to temperature.
- Sentence 14: In general, water absorption increases as temperature increases.
- Sentence 15: The relationship between water absorption and temperature can be expressed as: unsaturated water absorption (%) = 14.289T-10.719 (where T is temperature, â„ƒ).
```

#### Analysis:
```yaml
Scope: "Study of water absorption characteristics in rice seeds"
Aspects: 
  - AspectName: "General description of water absorption curve"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 1
      end: 3
  - AspectName: "Rice water absorption and moisture content under varied humidity"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 4
      end: 8
    SubAspects:
      - AspectName: "Water absorption dynamics under varied humidity"
        SentenceRange:
          start: 4
          end: 5
      - AspectName: "Relationship between water absorption and moisture content"
        SentenceRange:
          start: 6
          end: 8
  - AspectName: "Stages of water absorption in rice seeds"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 9
      end: 12
  - AspectName: "Temperature influence on water absorption"
    SentenceRange: 
      start: 13
      end: 15
```

Now, analyze the provided sentences with the structured analytical process, and output your analysis in the structured YAML format.
NOTE: each aspect or subaspect should be highly summarized and self-conatined, which covers at least two sentences, except for introduction or conclusion aspects.
